Github won't allow php files to run, so the subscribe form will not work unless you drop it on your own server.

At this point if you're not familiar with Grunt, CoffeeScript or SCSS, you can just go into ```app``` folder and update html, js, css files there. 

#### Usage

***

* Run ```npm install``` in your console, that will install all the dependencies. If you dont have Grunt installed, run ```npm install -g grunt-cli	```
* Now just run ```grunt```. This will complite all your coffeescript and scss files located in ```dev``` folder.

The rest should make sense. To upate your javascript edit ```dev/coffee/application.coffee``` file.

To update your css files look inside the ```dev/scss/``` directory. There is a bunch of files there. Everything is split into paritals to keep it organized. The ```lib``` folder contains 3rd party mixins for sass (bourbon).
